The new system is to control the following patient invoices, inconsistencies and costs. Here the main thing is to provide a platform for orphan organizations to explore their identity to the donors, here in this project we want to create a cloud based application which acts as a common platform for all orphan organizations. These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost effective manner, entering the details about the blood groups members, addresses etc. with the goal of reducing the time and unavailability currently required for such tasks. Due to this criterion there is a possibility for a growth in fake organizations to earn money from the donors.
